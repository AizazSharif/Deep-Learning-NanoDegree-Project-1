# Simple Neural Network

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. 

## Installation and Usage

Clone the GitHub repository and install the dependencies.
* Download anaconda or miniconda
* Create the environment for this project
```
conda create --name dlnd python=3

```
* Enter your new environment:
  * Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
  * Windows: >> activate dlnd
  
* Install the following libraries

 ```
 conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

 ```
* Clone the repo and go to directory 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AizazSharif/P1-DLND-Simple-Neural-Network.git
$ cd P1-DLND-Simple-Neural-Network

```
* Run the **jupyter notebook** command in terminal and open .ipynb file.
* Go through each cell for better understanding of the code and dataset.
